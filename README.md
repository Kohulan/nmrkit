# Overview of NMR Predict

The project aims to develop a microservice for NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) prediction, which will allow users to predict the NMR spectrum of a molecule quickly and accurately. The microservice will be designed as a RESTful API, which can be easily integrated into existing applications or used as a standalone service.
